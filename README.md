# FirstExercise

Our application is called "Chatter". Download all the files from this repositery to a new folder. The log in file is called "login.html", you should start by opening it. A log-in screen should appear, in which you can enter a username and password and log in, or register if you don't have an account.
If you click "register", it will take you to our register page called "register.html", in which you would be able to create a new account and register.
If you click "log in" or "register" in the register page, you will arrive to our chat screen, in which for now there is a fake conversation and messages from fake contacts (only for this exercise).
